### how to spy on someone 101

- make sure you have rust nightly

```bash
# download all solutions
./solspy d scpchicken

# run with current solutions
./solspy scpchicken
```

the scores are a bit off i think it's because i dont think theres no way to differentiate between a chars and a bytes solution. this messes up the `n` value in the calculation. feel free to make a pr if you can fix this.
